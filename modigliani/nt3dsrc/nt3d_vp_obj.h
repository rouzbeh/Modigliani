/** @short NT3D_vp_o class
Superclass that unifys a common interface for
abstract viewport implementations and their
driver dependend realisations for various window systems (viewport driver).
NT3D_drv_vp_o basically provides an implementation for
all the functionality or infrastructure defined by this class,
which is assigned to an NT3D_abstract_vp_o which uses this infrastructure.
In this context it is possible that an NT3D_abstract_vp_o can be assigned
to different drivers. On the other side the abstract viewport
should provide all drawing within the Draw() method for the viewport 
drivers, which is the only method called from the driver classes.
In the other direction the abstract classes should actually avoid
to call the Draw() method themselves.
